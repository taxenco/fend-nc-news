# FE-NC-News

FE-NC-News is a news aggregation site built in React making API calls from the back end server. It allows users to view web content and enter in discussion by voting, adding and deleting comments, as well as voting for articles.

The articles can be seen by three different topics (coding, football and cooking) or all together when the "Articles" option is selected. These can be sorted by votes, created day and comment count.
